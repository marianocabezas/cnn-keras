# CNN-Keras
CNN repository based on Keras

Since Keras will now be the new high-level library for TensorFlow, it includes the Theano backend and it provides a better API than Lasagne and nolearn, I'm working on migrating all my previous cnn code to that backend.

The idea is to keep the functionality of my cnn-nolearn with the new framework. It will simplify all the BatchIterator stuff and I might have to work on custom layers soon. I might also drop any support to the cnn-nolearn repository if I migrate all my code succesfully.
